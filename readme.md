## Why a vector graphics program?
Why would a software engineer choose to a vector graphics program to edit his resume? Why not use Microsoft Word? Simple...for layout, this is the right tool. In my first two professional (non-retail) jobs were as a desktop publisher (Kinkos & Safeguard). I grew up on Macromedia Freehand, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe PageMaker, and QuarkXPress.

## Why Sketch?
- `Sketch.app` is affordable relative to other such programs.
- `Sketch.app` feels lightweight and performant.
- `Sketch.app` developers seem to understand what good UX should be.
- `Sketch.app` is programmable and thus there are several useful, free plugins available.
- `Sketch.app` is provides almost everything I've always wished the programs above had ... for example, a sane scripting engine.
- `Sketch.app` is great for software prototyping, mocks, and diagrams as well.

## Why put all this work into a document?
I enjoy the process. Furthermore, this is a document that will follow me for the rest of my career.

## Organization Strategy
The `.sketch` file is organized at the highest level using pages (i.e. `Page 1`, `Page 2`, `Page N`), with each page organized into `TOP`, `MIDDLE`, and `BOTTOM` recursively locked layer groups.

## Plugins Used
- [annotations-sketch-plugin][]: used to hide/show `firm` as necessary.

## Want to steal this?
I'm OK with that; I only ask `10` things :)

0. Fork this repo so there is a link back to this repo.
0. Remix vs copy the design; give it your own flavor.
