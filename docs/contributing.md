## Forks are OK!
I'm OK with you forking and remixing for your own purposes...remember to give it your own flavor.

## Suggested Plugins
- [annotations-sketch-plugin](https://github.com/BaguetteEngineering/annotations-sketch-plugin): used to hide/show `firm` as necessary.

## Organization Strategy
The `.sketch` file is organized at the highest level using pages (i.e. `Page 1`, `Page 2`, `Page N`), with each page organized into `TOP`, `MIDDLE`, and `BOTTOM` recursively locked layer groups.
