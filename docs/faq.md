## Why a vector graphics program?
Why would a software engineer choose to a vector graphics program to edit his resume? Why not use Microsoft Word? Simple...for layout, this is the right tool. In my first two professional (non-retail) jobs were as a desktop publisher (Kinkos & Safeguard). I grew up on Macromedia Freehand, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe PageMaker, and QuarkXPress.

## Why Sketch?
- `Sketch.app` is affordable relative to other such programs.
- `Sketch.app` feels lightweight and performant.
- `Sketch.app` developers seem to understand what good UX should be.
- `Sketch.app` is programmable and thus there are several useful, free plugins available.
- `Sketch.app` is provides almost everything I've always wished the programs above had ... for example, a sane scripting engine.
- `Sketch.app` is great for software prototyping, mocks, and diagrams as well.

## Why put all this work into a document?
I enjoy the process. Furthermore, this is a document that will follow me for the rest of my career.
